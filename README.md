## Definitions

### Employee Classification 
This determines the rules for overtime, breaks, and other labor law specifics. For example, exempt (salaried) employees may have different rules than non-exempt (hourly) employees.

### Regular Hourly Rate
This is the base rate of pay for standard work hours. It's essential for calculating regular pay and serves as the basis for calculating overtime and double time rates. 

### Overtime Hourly Rate and Threshold
In California, overtime is typically paid at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours worked over 8 in a day and 40 in a week. Knowing when overtime applies and the rate is crucial for accurate payroll.

### Double Time and Threshold
California's law also requires double time pay (2 times the regular rate) for hours worked over 12 in a day and for all hours worked beyond 8 on the seventh consecutive working day in a workweek. It's important to know when this rule kicks in.

### Special Pay Conditions
This can include bonuses, commissions, shift differentials, and other pay variations. These elements can affect the overall calculation of pay, particularly in how they interact with overtime rules (e.g., some bonuses may need to be included in the calculation of the regular rate for overtime purposes).


## Future adjustments

### Meal and Rest Breaks
Under California law, non-exempt employees are entitled to rest breaks and meal periods, which might need to be factored into the work hours.

### Workweek Definition
Specific start and end days for a workweek.

### Holiday Pay
Some businesses offer additional pay for working on holidays, which might need to be included.

### Weekend or Night Shift Differentials
If your organization has higher pay rates for weekends or night shifts, these should be included in the calculations.
